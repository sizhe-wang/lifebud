## Reference: CloudflareDeployer

> Documentation for the CloudflareDeployer class, which deploys Mastra applications to Cloudflare Workers.

The `CloudflareDeployer` class handles deployment of standalone Mastra applications to Cloudflare Workers. It manages configuration, deployment, and extends the base [Deployer](https://mastra.ai/reference/v1/deployer/) class with Cloudflare specific functionality.

## Usage example

```typescript title="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { CloudflareDeployer } from "@mastra/deployer-cloudflare";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  deployer: new CloudflareDeployer({
    name: "hello-mastra",
    routes: [
      {
        pattern: "example.com/*",
        zone_name: "example.com",
        custom_domain: true
      }
    ],
    vars: {
      NODE_ENV: "production",
      API_KEY: "<api-key>"
    },
    d1_databases: [
      {
        binding: "DB",
        database_name: "my-database",
        database_id: "d1-database-id",
        preview_database_id: "your-preview-database-id"
      }
    ],
    kv_namespaces: [
      {
        binding: "CACHE",
        id: "kv-namespace-id"
      }
    ]
  })
});
```

## Constructor options

The `CloudflareDeployer` constructor accepts the same configuration options as `wrangler.json`. See the [Wrangler configuration documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) for all available options.

### Migrating from earlier versions

The following fields are deprecated and should be replaced with their standard `wrangler.json` equivalents:

| Deprecated | Use instead |
|------------|-------------|
| `projectName` | `name` |
| `d1Databases` | `d1_databases` |
| `kvNamespaces` | `kv_namespaces` |
| `workerNamespace` | *(removed, no longer used)* |

## Reference: NetlifyDeployer

> Documentation for the NetlifyDeployer class, which deploys Mastra applications to Netlify Functions.

The `NetlifyDeployer` class handles deployment of standalone Mastra applications to Netlify. It manages configuration, deployment, and extends the base [Deployer](https://mastra.ai/reference/v1/deployer/) class with Netlify specific functionality.

## Usage example

```typescript title="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { NetlifyDeployer } from "@mastra/deployer-netlify";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  deployer: new NetlifyDeployer(),
});
```

## Reference: VercelDeployer

> Documentation for the VercelDeployer class, which deploys Mastra applications to Vercel.

The `VercelDeployer` class handles deployment of standalone Mastra applications to Vercel. It manages configuration, deployment, and extends the base [Deployer](https://mastra.ai/reference/v1/deployer/) class with Vercel specific functionality.

## Usage example

```typescript title="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { VercelDeployer } from "@mastra/deployer-vercel";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  deployer: new VercelDeployer(),
});
```

## Constructor options

The deployer supports a small set of high‑value overrides that are written to the Vercel Output API function config (`.vc-config.json`):

- `maxDuration?: number` — Function execution timeout (in seconds)
- `memory?: number` — Function memory (in MB)
- `regions?: string[]` — Regions to deploy the function (e.g. `['sfo1','iad1']`)

These options are merged into `.vercel/output/functions/index.func/.vc-config.json` while preserving default fields (`handler`, `launcherType`, `runtime`, `shouldAddHelpers`).

### Example with overrides

```typescript title="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { VercelDeployer } from "@mastra/deployer-vercel";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  deployer: new VercelDeployer({
    maxDuration: 600,
    memory: 1536,
    regions: ["sfo1", "iad1"],
  }),
});
```
