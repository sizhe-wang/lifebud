# Using Tools

Tools are functions that agents can execute to perform specific tasks or access external information. They extend an agent's capabilities beyond simple text generation, allowing interaction with APIs, databases, or other systems.

Each tool typically defines:

- **Inputs:** What information the tool needs to run (defined with an `inputSchema`, often using Zod).
- **Outputs:** The structure of the data the tool returns (defined with an `outputSchema`).
- **Execution Logic:** The code that performs the tool's action.
- **Description:** Text that helps the agent understand what the tool does and when to use it.

## Creating Tools

In Mastra, you create tools using the [`createTool`](https://mastra.ai/reference/v1/tools/create-tool) function from the `@mastra/core/tools` package.

```typescript title="src/mastra/tools/weatherInfo.ts"
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

const getWeatherInfo = async (city: string) => {
  // Replace with an actual API call to a weather service
  console.log(`Fetching weather for ${city}...`);
  // Example data structure
  return { temperature: 20, conditions: "Sunny" };
};

export const weatherTool = createTool({
  id: "Get Weather Information",
  description: `Fetches the current weather information for a given city`,
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string().describe("City name"),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    temperature: z.number(),
    conditions: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async (inputData) => {
    console.log("Using tool to fetch weather information for", inputData.city);
    return await getWeatherInfo(inputData.city);
  },
});
```

This example defines a `weatherTool` with an input schema for the city, an output schema for the weather data, and an `execute` function that contains the tool's logic.

When creating tools, keep tool descriptions simple and focused on **what** the tool does and **when** to use it, emphasizing its primary use case. Technical details belong in the parameter schemas, guiding the agent on _how_ to use the tool correctly with descriptive names, clear descriptions, and explanations of default values.

## Adding Tools to an Agent

To make tools available to an agent, you configure them in the agent's definition. Mentioning available tools and their general purpose in the agent's system prompt can also improve tool usage. For detailed steps and examples, see the guide on [Using Tools with Agents](https://mastra.ai/docs/v1/agents/using-tools#adding-tools-to-an-agent).

## Using `RequestContext`

Use [RequestContext](https://mastra.ai/docs/v1/server/request-context) to access request-specific values. This lets you conditionally adjust behavior based on the context of the request.

```typescript title="src/mastra/tools/test-tool.ts"
export type UserTier = {
  "user-tier": "enterprise" | "pro";
};

const advancedTools = () => {};

const baseTools = () => {};

export const testTool = createTool({
  execute: async (inputData, context) => {
    const userTier = context?.requestContext?.get("user-tier") as UserTier["user-tier"];

    return userTier === "enterprise" ? advancedTools : baseTools;
  },
});
```

## Testing with Studio

Use [Studio](https://mastra.ai/docs/v1/getting-started/studio) to test tools with different inputs, inspect execution results, and verify tool behavior.
