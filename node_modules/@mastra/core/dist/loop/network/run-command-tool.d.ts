 * Creates a tool that lets agents run shell commands with security restrictions.

 * @security WARNING: This tool executes shell commands. Even with restrictions,
 * it should NEVER be used with untrusted input. Always:
 * - Configure allowedCommands to restrict which commands can run
 * - Configure allowedBasePaths to restrict working directories
 * - Review agent prompts to understand what commands may be generated
 * - Consider additional sandboxing (containers, VMs) for production use
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Secure configuration with allowlists
 * const agent = new Agent({
 *   tools: {
 *     runCommand: createRunCommandTool({
 *       allowedCommands: ['git', 'npm', 'node'],
