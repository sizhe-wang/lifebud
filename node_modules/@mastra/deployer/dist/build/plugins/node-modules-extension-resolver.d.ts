 * Rollup plugin that resolves module extensions for external dependencies.
 *
 * This plugin handles ESM compatibility for external imports when node-resolve is not used:
 * - Packages WITH exports field (e.g., hono, date-fns): Keep imports as-is or strip redundant extensions
 * - Packages WITHOUT exports field (e.g., lodash): Add .js extension for direct file imports
